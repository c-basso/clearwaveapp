        {
          "question": "How long should I play the sound to remove water?",
          "answer": "Usually 10-30 seconds is enough, but you can repeat the process if needed. You can test your speaker volume after each cycle to check if the sound has improved."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if the water ejection doesn't work?",
          "answer": "If water ejection doesn't work immediately, try repeating the process 2-3 times. For stubborn water, you can also try the frequency tone generator at different frequencies. If the problem persists, it might indicate hardware damage that requires professional repair."
