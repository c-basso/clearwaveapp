        {
          "question": "How do I fix iPhone speaker sound?",
          "answer": "Open Clear Wave and run the speaker fix water ejection. Calibrated frequencies push out trapped water and debris. Repeat 2–3 times, then test volume with the stereo test."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does speaker fix work on all devices?",
          "answer": "Clear Wave speaker fix works on iPhone and iPad. It requires iOS 15.1 or later and provides the best results on Apple hardware."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does a speaker fix take?",
          "answer": "Most speaker fixes take 10–30 seconds per cycle. If sound is still muffled, repeat the water ejection 2–3 times and check both channels with the stereo test."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if my speaker fix doesn't work immediately?",
          "answer": "Repeat the process. Try different frequencies with the tone generator. If distortion persists, it may indicate a blown speaker that needs professional repair."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the speaker fix app free to use?",
          "answer": "Clear Wave is free to download with core speaker fix and water ejection. Advanced audio tools like the pro tone generator are available via in‑app purchase."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can this help with a blown speaker?",
          "answer": "If your speaker is blown, the app can diagnose issues (channel tests, distortion checks) and sometimes improve performance by clearing debris or water. Severe damage requires repair or replacement."
